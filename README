This project can help researchers simulate drones under omnet++. Moreover, we describe the use of the INET framework to create a scenario containing communication between drones by sending and exchanging messages between them using the UDP application. However, it is much more interested in the integration of UAV-cloud into a FANET network that presents many technical and conceptual challenges. First, it is essential to develop effective resource management mechanisms to ensure optimal resource allocation to Client Drones (CDs). This involves taking into account the specific constraints linked to drones, such as their limited computing capacities and their energy constraints. Second, the Quality of Service (QoS) varies from one Provider of Drones (PDs) to another. Thus, CDs attempt to select the most appropriate services. Therefore, this work is interested in using Ground Station (GS) that acts as the repository of offered and requested services, besides the game theory which can be defined as the mathematical model for service selection inside the GS, and in especially interactive decision-making, in which each participant's or "player" outcome is influenced by the actions of others. In light of this, it is possible to apply game theory to our work to assist drone clients in discovering and selecting the best services for their needs. For this reason, CDs naturally expect to receive as many services as possible within their limited budgets; while PDs attempt to maximize their utility by incentivizing clients to pay for their limited number of services. Before applying, the services must be discovered by clients and clients must also be able to learn about the different services available. CDs choose the best service and suitable providers in terms of QoS and service price.
